Java inner class or nested class is a class i.e. declared inside the class or interface.

We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.

Syntax of Inner class

 //code  
 class Java_Inner_class{  
  //code  
 }  
}  

Advantage of java inner classes

There are basically three advantages of inner classes in java. They are as follows:

1) Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.

2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.

3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
